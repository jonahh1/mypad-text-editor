# My Pad
###### (bad name I know)

My pad is a text editor based on windows notepad (sort of). Its my first released project so I would **not** advise looking at the code, its like a headphone cables and spaghetti combined.

you can live edit the editors appearance by editing the config.json, saving and typing ctrl+r, so thats kinda cool
